This program uses the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the famous Iris dataset, which contains samples of iris flowers along with their corresponding species. The dataset consists of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and three classes of iris plants (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).
The program begins by loading the Iris dataset and splitting it into training and test sets. It then standardizes the features to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations in the KNN algorithm. Next, it creates a KNN classifier with k=3, meaning it considers the three nearest neighbors to make a classification decision.
In the Iris dataset used in the KNN project, the labels represent the different species of iris flowers. There are three classes of iris plants in the dataset:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Each sample in the dataset is labeled with one of these classes, indicating the species of the corresponding iris flower. The goal of the KNN algorithm in this project is to predict the correct label (species) for a given iris flower based on its features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).
The classifier is trained on the training data, and then it predicts the class labels for the test data. Finally, the program calculates the accuracy of the classifier by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels in the test set and prints the accuracy score. This program showcases a common machine learning workflow for classification tasks using the KNN algorithm and demonstrates how to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.
